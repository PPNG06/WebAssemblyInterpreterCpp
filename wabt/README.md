# Bundled WABT snapshot

This directory contains a trimmed copy of the [WABT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
(WebAssembly Binary Toolkit) sources. Only the pieces needed to build
`wat2wasm` (so we can assemble the test fixtures and examples) are kept; the
rest of the upstream project and its documentation have been removed to keep
this repository light-weight.

WABT is maintained by the WebAssembly community. Refer to the upstream
repository for detailed documentation, license texts, and the latest releases.
